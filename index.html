    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Jason, a curious and driven student from Namibia with a heart that beats for change. I'm an ambitious and optimistic individual with a keen enthusiasm for learning and self-development. From being the junior dux learner of Augustineum secondary school in 2019,to being the Headboy of the school in 2022 while being a city of Windhoek Junior Council member. Right now, I’m studying at UWC Dilijan thanks to a Star for Life scholarship, which has opened my eyes to global perspectives and new ways of thinking. I'm passionate about robotics, music, and volleyball, but more than anything, I care about people and justice. Whether it's exploring big questions in philosophy or finding ways to support displaced young hearts through empowerment projects, I try to lead with intention.</p>
